# Responsive-website-for-GMO
Welcome to the Repsonsive Website for GMO repository. This project provides detailed insights into genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the role of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) in regulating these organisms. Our visually stunning website, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features images of approved GMOs, popular genetically modified fruits and vegetables, and integrates two powerful models: a chatbot expert on GMOs and GEAC, and a sentiment analysis model. We made this website in such a way that the website can also be viewed in mobile with the appropriate dimensions.
